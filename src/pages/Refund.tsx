        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          At SajBiopaks, part of Rums Enterprise, we specialize in the design,
          manufacturing, and distribution of customized packaging solutions for
          cakes, sweets, broast, and other food items. Every order is carefully
          tailored to meet the unique needs of bakeries, restaurants, caterers,
          and food businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our commitment is to deliver eco-friendly, durable, and premium-quality
          packaging that reflects the standards of your brand. Because our
          products are custom-made to order and designed based on specific
          requirements, we operate under a strict No Refund Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Refund Policy outlines the rights and responsibilities of our
          customers and clarifies why refunds are not permitted. By placing an
          order through our website, you acknowledge and agree to the terms
          herein.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Strict No Refund Policy</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li><strong>3.1. No Refunds:</strong> Once an order is confirmed and payment is processed, SajBiopaks will not issue any refunds, partial or full, under any circumstances.</li>
          <li><strong>3.2. Customization Clause:</strong> Since products are custom-designed, manufactured, and branded specifically for each client, they cannot be resold or reused for another customer.</li>
          <li><strong>3.3. Final Sale:</strong> All sales made via SajBiopaks are final and binding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Customer Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>To avoid disputes or dissatisfaction, customers are responsible for the following before confirming their order:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Reviewing product specifications, including size, material, and thickness.</li>
          <li>Checking and approving designs, logos, and branding artwork.</li>
          <li>Verifying quantity requirements and delivery timelines.</li>
          <li>Confirming packaging features such as compartments, coatings, or add-ons.</li>
          <li>Providing accurate shipping information to ensure smooth delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Failure to provide accurate information or review requirements thoroughly
          will not constitute grounds for a refund.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Order Confirmation</h2>
        <p>
          Orders will only be processed after written or digital confirmation is
          received from the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers must provide final approval of designs, artwork, and order
          specifications. SajBiopaks will share proofs, samples, or digital
          previews for confirmation wherever applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once an order is approved and confirmed by the customer, no changes,
          cancellations, or refund requests will be entertained.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Exceptions</h2>
        <p>
          While our Refund Policy is strict, we acknowledge certain exceptional
          circumstances where we may consider a resolution (not in the form of
          refunds, but alternate solutions like replacements):
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Manufacturing Defect:</strong> If the product delivered is materially defective or does not match the approved specifications, SajBiopaks will review the case.</li>
          <li><strong>Damage in Transit:</strong> If products are damaged during shipping, customers must notify us within 48 hours of delivery, with photographs as evidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Shortage in Quantity:</strong> Any shortage must be reported immediately upon delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In such cases, SajBiopaks may offer a replacement or credit note at its
          sole discretion. Refunds will not be issued even in these cases.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Intellectual Property & Design Approval</h2>
        <p>
          Customers providing artwork, logos, and branding materials must ensure
          they have legal rights to use them. SajBiopaks is not responsible for
          disputes arising from unauthorized use of intellectual property.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once customers approve the final design, SajBiopaks is not liable for
          spelling errors, design flaws, or logo issues overlooked during approval.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Liability Limitation</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
